# CartpoleHierarchy

Repo where I try to control the underactuated dynamics of the cartpole via a hierarchical controller. I will construct a controller which exponentially tracks trajectories of theta, then try to construct a mid-level controller which finds trajectories in angle space which result in stable zero dynamics, with some ISS-like result obtained through the hierarchy.
